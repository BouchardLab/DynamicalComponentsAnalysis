Welcome to the documentation for Dynamical Components Analysis (DCA)!
=====================================================================

Dynamical Components Analysis is a method for performing linear dimensionality reduction
on time series data which seeks to find the low-dimensional subspace that has high
dynamical complexity. The library described here (`dca`) implements the models
and analyses used in the paper [Clark2019]_.
